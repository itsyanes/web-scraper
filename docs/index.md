## Description

Web-Scraper is a command-line application used to extract data from any website. It respects the KISS approach. It is quite customizable thanks to multiple options from its configuration file.

## Getting Started

This repos does not provide any binaries, therefore you will have to compile the program yourself. Further installations instructions are available on the README of the [github repos page](https://github.com/TheGhostSpirit/web-scraper).
